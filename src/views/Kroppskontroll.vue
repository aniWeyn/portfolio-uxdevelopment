        Kroppskontroll had its own landing page and wanted to add a booking
        system that matched the look and feel of their existing website. I
        designed the booking flow by balancing their requirements with my own UX
        recommendations, and created a user interface that seamlessly integrated
        with their current visual style.

      A few weeks later, Kroppskontroll contacted us with an updated visual
      identity and requested a matching update to the booking system. I
      redesigned the booking interface to align with their new design guidelines
      and ensure a consistent user experience across the site. In addition, a
      new section of the system—My Side—was commissioned. I designed this
      feature in collaboration with the graphic designer behind the updated
      visual identity.

    <h4>Front-end development advisor</h4>
    <p>
      I advised the front-end developer on the use of CSS Grid and Flexbox to
      ensure efficient and responsive layout implementation for the project.
