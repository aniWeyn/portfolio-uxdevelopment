    <h4>UX Research / UX Design</h4>
    <h5>Field studies - mobile app</h5>
    I organised field studies where I observed how users were interacting with
    zoopits mobile application. To create notes I used Apple Notes where
    whenever user had a problem I made a photo of screen and make a note about
    the problem. I was noting as well other user comments and stories which
    could help Zoopit understad its' value. Notes were later presented to the
    developers and the rest of the team. From the notes I have created a backlog
    tasks with bugs/improvements.

    <h5>Field studies / rapid prototyping - proof of concept</h5>
    Potential customer asked Zoopit to prepare a proof of concept solution for
    their delivery problem. To plan the best possible solution I have visited
    potential customer warehouses, observed work in the warehouses, interviewed
    daily managers. Based on interview and observations from fields studies, as
    well as workshops with the customers I have prepared interactive wireframes
    in Figma. The process of creating wireframes consited of two iteration.
    First draft were created based on workshop with customer. Then the idea were
    confronted with field studies and improved. In Figma I have created three
    flows which represented one main use case and two edge cases.

    <h4>Project Management</h4>
    I helped Zoopit to defined their projects in roadmaps, as well as project
    into tasks, as well I helped to keep requested features in one place. We
    first used tool ZenHub but later we decided to move to Favro. I organised a
    place which is shared with customers where they can see the status of
    requested features or issues. I ran daily 20 minutes stand up with whole
    team.

    <h4>Quality Assurance / Development</h4>
    <h5>Support</h5>
    I read support requests, asked customers for more details on issue, decided
    is it a task that I can solve as developer or should it be passed to other
    developer. Most often I update or query for some information MongoDB
    documents with a use of Robo 3T.

    <h5>Mobile Application QA</h5>
    I manually test mobile application to assure quality and high standards.
