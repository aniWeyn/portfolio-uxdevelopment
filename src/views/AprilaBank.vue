    <h2>AprilaBank</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
      Aprila Bank is a dynamic and modern Norwegian startup based in Oslo. I had
      the opportunity to work there as both a UX Designer and a Front-End
      Developer.
    </p>
    <section><b>Project timeline:</b> a few months</section>
    <b>Roles:</b> UX / UI Designer, Design System Developer, VueJS Developer,
    Blazor Developer

    <h4>UX / UI Designer</h4>
    <b>Technologies: </b> Sketch, Miro, OOUX, journey mapping, observations,
    co-designing
    <p>
      I conducted internal research to improve Aprila Bank’s internal
      application, using methods such as product journey mapping, interviews,
      and user observations. Based on these insights, I prepared design
      solutions for the development team.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked alongside the UX Lead to improve the integration of UX
      methodologies into the company’s processes—such as continuous
      development—and to strengthen UX understanding among developers and
      management.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was involved in designing new solutions using Object-Oriented UX and
      co-design methodologies. These approaches helped create more structured,
      user-centered designs and fostered a shared understanding across the team.
    </p>

    <h4>Design System</h4>
    <b>Technologies: </b> Storybook, WebComponents, CSS Components, MDX, BEM,
    <p>
      Aprila Design System provided front-end developers & engineers a
      collection of reusable HTML and CSS partials to build websites and user
      interfaces. Adopting the library enabled developers to use consistent
      markup, styles, and behavior in prototype and production work. I had a
      chance to join this project and continue its' development.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Aprila design system was documented using Storybook, with component
      stories written in the MDX format. This allowed for rich, interactive
      documentation that clearly communicated the usage and behavior of each
      component.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design system components were developed in two versions—Web Components
      and pure CSS components—to ensure easy integration with Blazor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was responsible for developing new components based on the UX Lead’s
      guidelines, documenting the design system, and guiding developers in its
      usage. I also maintained the changelog, managed versioning, and handled
      distribution of the system as an NPM package.

    <h4>Development</h4>
    <b>Technologies: </b> VueJS, Blazor Developer
    <p>
      As the only team member with experience in Vue.js, I was responsible for
      rewriting the architecture of the customer registration form to meet
      updated requirements. The application required a bit of reverse
      engineering, as it had originally been built by a highly skilled senior
      front-end developer. Refactoring such well-written code was both
      intellectually rewarding and a pleasure—it gave me the opportunity to
      explore advanced and clever uses of Vue.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to fact that UX Lead was working in Sketch I needed to begin using
      Mac. To work with the .NET framework on macOS, I set up a virtual Windows
      desktop using VirtualBox. This allowed me to contribute to Blazor
      development despite the limited support for .NET on Mac at the time.
    </p>
    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p>
      Aprila Bank’s needs for feature updates, design system maintenance, and
      development had been met. I genuinely hope that the UX Lead—being the sole
      UX and UI designer in the company—felt supported and understood,
      especially in his efforts to help the development team grasp his vision,
      understand its importance, and feel encouraged to follow his expertise.
