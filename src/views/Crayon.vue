      Crayon wanted to test a new customer screening survey with a complex
      structure that standard tools like SurveyMonkey couldnâ€™t support. I
      contributed by reviewing the survey from a research perspective (e.g.,
      identifying leading questions) and primarily by prototyping the survey to
      enable user testing and evaluation of its usability.

    <h4>VueJS Developer</h4>
    <p>
      I have choosen VueJS for this project due to fact that at that time that
      was the lightest framework for rapid prototyping. Survey questions and
      replies were saved in json file. The result of survey were saved in
      Firabse.
    </p>
    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p>
      Sales team could quickly test their ideas and move forwards with project.
