    <p class="project-description">
      W3Schools is a Norwegian-based educational website founded in 1998 by Jan
      Egil Refsnes, offering free and interactive tutorials on web development
      technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL. Known for its
      beginner-friendly approach, it features the "Try It Yourself" editor,
      enabling users to experiment with code directly in the browser.

    W3school.
