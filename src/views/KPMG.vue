    <h4>UX / UI Designer</h4>
    For KPMG Norway, I had the opportunity to design a high-fidelity, clickable
    prototype in Figma that represented the vision for the future solution. I
    was responsible for balancing the creation of a unique visual identity for
    the project while ensuring alignment with KPMG's overall brand guidelines.
    <br />
    <br />
    What made this project particularly interesting was that I was designing for
    myself as the developer. This meant I had to be especially mindful of the
    technical feasibility of my designs, ensuring that what I created in Figma
    could be realistically and efficiently implemented in code.

    <h4>VueJS Developer</h4>
    After the design phase, I contributed to the project as part of a two-person
    development team—myself as the frontend developer, alongside a senior
    backend developer. What made the KPMG project unique was that we were not
    granted access to the backend codebase. This constraint required a high
    degree of flexibility and close collaboration between the frontend and
    backend teams to ensure seamless integration and functionality. <br /><br />

    Because I was responsible for both designing and implementing the frontend,
    this experience strengthened my realistic mindset in design. It made me more
    mindful of creating solutions that were not only user-friendly but also
    technically feasible—prioritizing simplicity, clarity, and reliability in
    both the design and the code.
    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    KPMG Norway was prototyping a new solution they planned to pitch to KPMG
    Global. With our support, the proposal was successfully accepted and later
    adopted by KPMG Global.
