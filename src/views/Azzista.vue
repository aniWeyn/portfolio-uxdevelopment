      <b>Roles:</b> UX / UI Designer, React Developer, Project Management
      <h3>Phase 1</h3>
      <h4>UX / UI Designer</h4>
      <b>Technology:</b>
      Figma, Storybook, ChakraUI <br />
      <p>
        I was invited to join a team of three developers—two junior and one
        senior—with the task of reviewing the client-provided information and
        creating a prototype to guide the development process. My role was to
        clarify requirements and translate them into a clear, usable design that
        the team could implement effectively. I created a high-fidelity
        prototype in Figma, designed with Chakra UI as the intended framework.
        The prototype served both as a visual guide for the development team and
        as a tool to ensure alignment between the developers and the
        stakeholders.

      <h3>Phase 2</h3>
      <h4>UX / UI Designer</h4>
      <b>Technology:</b>
      AdobeXD, co-design workshops, usability testing, competition comparison
      <br />
      <p>
        In the second phase, I had the opportunity to work directly with the
        stakeholder through a series of <strong>co-design</strong> sessions. I
        saw this as a valuable moment to incorporate principles from
        <strong>socially ethical design</strong>, as proposed by
        <a href="https://edelwax.medium.com/" target="_blank">Joe Edelman</a>,
        along with ideas from
        <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/" target="_blank">Tristan Harris</a>
        and the Center for Humane Technology— ensuring the application supports
        screen-free time while still enabling young football players to share
        their achievements and feel inspired by the progress of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a strong understanding of the project and its mission, I had the
        opportunity to invite a senior graphic designer to help us establish the
        visual identity for the project. We transitioned the prototype to Adobe
        XD, where I continued the work as a UX designer using UI components
        developed by the graphic designer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this phase, I was responsible for designing both the web and mobile
        versions of the application. While the senior graphic designer focused
        solely on the mobile experience, it was my responsibility to ensure that
        the web version accurately reflected the visual style and functionality
        of the mobile design.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the project, I also conducted a
        <strong>competitive analysis</strong> to ensure that the application
        offers added value not found in other similar apps. We discovered that
        the app could differentiate itself by including social-media-like
        content, allowing football players to express themselves through their
        profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        As testing with potential end-users was not permitted, I ensured the
        clarity and usability of the application's features by conducting
        usability tests with the development team and available consultants who
        were not directly involved in the project.
      </p>
      <h4>Project Management</h4>
      <b>Technology:</b> Azure DevOps, Agile, Kanban
      <p>
        I contributed to project management by breaking down and describing
        features and UI elements, creating tasks in the Azure DevOps board, and
        making decisions on task prioritization. I also followed up on the
        team’s progress to ensure alignment with the project goals and
        timelines. My responsibilities were focused on the UX and UI aspects of
        the application, while infrastructure-related tasks were defined and
        managed by other developers. The team worked within an Agile framework
        supported by regular Scrum meetings, which helped maintain clear
        communication and steady progress.
      </p>
      <h4>React Developer</h4>
      <b>Technology:</b>
      React, ChakraUI with elements of SASS and CSS Variables <br />
      <p>
        Our team of five growth to seven developers. use of CSS Variables and
        css styling to let developers create components in the most comfortable
        way for them with assuring consisten look through all application, I was
        responsible as well for layouting and components development.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, I had the opportunity to create a football field layout
        using CSS for the web solution:
        <a href="https://codepen.io/AniWeyn/full/oNLRKWE" target="_blank"
          >CodePen – Football Field</a
        >. This component was later adapted within the project to allow users to
        select their position on the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Quality Assurance:</b><br />
        I reviewed pull requests both as a designer and a developer, ensuring
        consistency in UI implementation and design intent. I also supported
        junior developers by providing guidance on semantic HTML, CSS Grid,
        Flexbox, ChakraUI usage.
      </p>
      <h4>Outcome</h4>
      <p>
        The stakeholder received the first functional version of the product,
        which they were able to use for securing funding, attracting investors,
        and inviting early access users to gather feedback and insights about
        the concept. The project now exists under the name
        <a href="https://www.dribblr.io/" target="_blank">Dribbl</a>, where many
        of the original ideas were retained, along with a continued strong
        emphasis on core values.
